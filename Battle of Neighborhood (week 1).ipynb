Various factors need to be studied inorder to decide on the Location such as : Safety of the place, Segmentation of the borough, Competition in the such location and many more."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Downloading and Preparing Data"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "##### Based on definition of our problem, factors that will influence our decission are:\n\n##### finding the safest borough based on crime statistics\n##### finding the most common venues\n\n##### We will be using the geographical coordinates of Toronto to plot neighborhoods in a borough that is safe and in the city's vicinity, and finally cluster our neighborhoods and present our findings.\n\n##### Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information\n\n##### Part 1 - Using the real world Data set of Toronto Crime Data from the website of Toronto Police Department. - A dataset consisting of the crime statistics of each Neighborhood in Toronto along with type of crime.

After selecting the borough it was imperative to choose the right neighborhood where grocery shops were not among venues in a close proximity to each other. We achieved this by grouping the neighborhoods into clusters to assist the stakeholders by providing them with relavent data about venues and safety of a given neighborhood."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Target Audience\n\n##### To recommend the correct location, XYZ Company Ltd has appointed me to lead of the Data Science team.
