"List of city-designated neighbourhoods in"
"Toronto"
"For administrative purposes, the City of Toronto divides the city into 140 neighbourhoods. These divisions"
"are used for internal planning purposes. The boundaries and names often do not conform to the usage of the"
"general population or designated business improvement areas. A number of neighbourhood maps of Toronto"
"do exist, some produced by real estate firms and some by Internet portals. A project to map the"
"neighbourhoods according to the common usage of the residents was done by the Toronto Star newspaper."
"Based on feedback from Star readers, it has produced the most comprehensive, albeit informal, neighbourhood"
"map."
